## Estuary-LX

This is my personal hack of the Kodi Estuary skin, based upon the [Kodi 19.3-Matrix release version](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/tree/19.3-Matrix/addons/skin.estuary).

### Changes
- Removed `Recent unwatched episodes` from the `Series` category.

### Installation
1. Put the `skin.estuary-lx` directory to `~/.kodi/addons`
2. Start Kodi, find the skin in the `Addons` menu, and **enable** it.
3. Use the skin.
4. Profit.

### License
- See the [original license](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/19.3-Matrix/addons/skin.estuary/LICENSE.txt).
